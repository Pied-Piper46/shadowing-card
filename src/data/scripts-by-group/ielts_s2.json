    "englishText": "Hello, Good morning. Thank you for coming today. What's your name please?",
    "japaneseTranslation": "こんにちは、おはようございます。本日はお越しいただきありがとうございます。お名前を教えていただけますか？",
    "explanation": "This is a standard and polite opening for an interview or meeting. 'Good morning' is a common greeting. 'Thank you for coming today' expresses gratitude for their presence. 'What's your name please?' is a direct and polite way to ask for someone's name. The grammar and phrasing are natural and correct."

    "japaneseTranslation": "私の名前はLe Mai Khanhですが、Khanhと呼んでください。",
    "explanation": "This is a straightforward introduction. 'but you can call me Khanh' is a common way to provide a preferred nickname or shorter version of one's name. The grammar is correct."

    "englishText": "How are you feeling today?",

    "englishText": "Of cource, a little worry, but it's great.",
    "japaneseTranslation": "もちろん、少し心配ですが、素晴らしいです。",
    "explanation": "Grammar issue: 'Of cource' should be 'Of course'. The phrase 'a little worry' is slightly unnatural; 'a little worried' or 'a bit worried' would be more common. The sentence structure is understandable but could be more fluent. A more natural phrasing might be: 'Of course, I'm a little worried, but I'm feeling great.'"

    "japaneseTranslation": "心配することはありません。カーンさん、今日のテストは約12分から15分で、3つのパートに分かれます。準備ができていれば、始めましょう。",
    "explanation": "This sentence is grammatically correct and clearly explains the test format and duration. 'Nothing to worry about' is a reassuring phrase. 'It will be in three parts' is clear. 'If you're ready, we can start' is a standard way to begin."

    "englishText": "How often do you use your mobile phone?",

    "japaneseTranslation": "正直に言うと、今はあまり使いません。1日約5時間です。それが少ないのかどうかは分かりません。",
    "explanation": "This is a natural and honest answer. 'Honestly' is a good adverb to start with. 'I don't use it much now' is clear. 'about 5 hours a day' provides specific information. 'I don't know if that's a little or not' expresses uncertainty in a common way. The grammar is correct."

    "japaneseTranslation": "しかし、携帯電話が世界における重要な発明であることは否定できないとわかりました。",
    "explanation": "Grammar issue: 'but' at the beginning of a sentence after a previous statement is acceptable in spoken English but can be improved for formal writing. 'I've found that' is fine. 'significant invention on the world' is slightly awkward; 'significant invention in the world' or 'significant invention of the world' would be more natural. The overall meaning is clear."

    "japaneseTranslation": "なぜなら、それは私たちに勉強し、新しい知識を獲得し、また娯楽を提供してくれるからです。",
    "explanation": "Grammar issue: 'it help us' should be 'it helps us' (third person singular subject requires 's'). 'acquire new knowledge' is good. 'and also the entertainment' is a bit abrupt; 'and also provides entertainment' or 'and for entertainment' would be smoother. The sentence structure is understandable but could be more polished."
  },

    "id": "ielts_s2_010",
    "englishText": "So that's why I really love my mobile phone.",
    "japaneseTranslation": "だからこそ、私は自分の携帯電話が本当に大好きです。",

    "englishText": "What do you usually use if for?",
    "japaneseTranslation": "普段は何のために携帯電話を使いますか？",

    "englishText": "As I say, I really love my mobile phone because it's not only birthday gift from my dad, but it's also like a weapon that help me a lot",
    "japaneseTranslation": "先ほども言いましたが、私は携帯電話が本当に好きです。なぜなら、それは父からの誕生日プレゼントであるだけでなく、私を大いに助けてくれる武器のようなものでもあるからです。",
    "explanation": "Grammar issue: 'birthday gift from my dad' should ideally be 'a birthday gift from my dad'. 'it's also like a weapon that help me a lot' - 'help' should be 'helps'. The metaphor of a 'weapon' is strong and perhaps a bit dramatic, but understandable in context as something that provides power or advantage. The sentence is a bit long and could be broken down for better clarity."

    "japaneseTranslation": "例えば、Tiktokから知識を得られます。ハッシュタグ「learnonTikTok」のようなものです。それをたくさん見ます。",
    "explanation": "This sentence is a bit fragmented. 'like it gives me knowledge' could be smoother. 'from the Tiktok' is acceptable in informal speech, but 'on TikTok' is more standard. 'I surf it a lot' is a colloquial way of saying 'I use it a lot' or 'I browse it frequently'. The use of 'like' twice in close succession is also a common filler in spoken English."

    "englishText": "Not at all anymore. I used to be the person that I cannot live without my mobile phone.",
    "japaneseTranslation": "もう全くありません。以前は携帯電話なしでは生きていけない人間でした。",
    "explanation": "'Not at all anymore' is a strong and clear negative answer. 'I used to be the person that I cannot live without my mobile phone' is a bit wordy. A more concise way would be: 'I used to be someone who couldn't live without my mobile phone.' or 'I used to be unable to live without my mobile phone.' The meaning is clear, however."

    "japaneseTranslation": "しかし、その後、私は一日中ただサーフィンしているだけで、新しい知識を得ていないことに気づきました。",
    "explanation": "'But then I realized' is a good transition. 'I just spend all my day just surfing' is a bit repetitive with 'just'. 'Surfing' here implies browsing the internet. 'and without new knowledge' is a bit abrupt; 'without gaining new knowledge' or 'and not learning anything new' would be more complete. The sentence conveys the intended meaning."
  },

    "id": "ielts_s2_018",

    "japaneseTranslation": "それで気づいたとき、私は変化を始めました。そしてはっきりと覚えているのは、電話に時間制限を設定して自分をコントロールできるようにすることから始めたということです。",
    "explanation": "This sentence is quite long and a bit convoluted. 'So when I realized that I started to change' is fine. 'and I can vividly remember that I would start with like I set the time limit on the phone so I can control myself' is grammatically awkward. 'I would start with like' is informal and could be 'I started by setting'. The phrase 'so I can control myself' is clear. A more fluent version might be: 'So, when I realized this, I started to change. I vividly remember starting by setting a time limit on my phone to control myself.'"

    "japaneseTranslation": "実際、リラックスする日にはたくさんのことをしますが、友達と過ごすこと以上に好きなことはありません。",
    "explanation": "Grammar issue: 'Acutually' should be 'Actually'. 'I have a lot of things to do on my relax days' is understandable, but 'relax days' is informal; 'days off' or 'leisure days' might be more common. 'I love nothing more than hanging out with my friends' is a strong expression meaning that hanging out with friends is their favorite activity. The grammar is mostly correct, aside from the spelling of 'Actually'."

    "japaneseTranslation": "はい、彼女をコーヒーショップに連れて行きますが、私たちは通常、お互いの家に来て食事を共有し、その週に起こったたくさんのことを彼女に話します。",
    "explanation": "Grammar issue: 'pick her to the coffee shop' is unclear. It might mean 'take her to the coffee shop' or 'meet her at the coffee shop'. 'come to each other house' should be 'come to each other's houses'. 'sharing the food' is fine. 'I would tell her a lot of things that happen in my week' is grammatically correct. The sentence is a bit disjointed due to the unclear phrasing at the beginning."

    "englishText": "And fortunately I feel really relaxed and unwind after long working days.",
    "japaneseTranslation": "そして幸いなことに、長い労働日の後には本当にリラックスしてくつろぐことができます。",
    "explanation": "This sentence is grammatically correct and expresses a positive feeling. 'Fortunately' is used correctly. 'relaxed and unwind' is a good pairing of adjectives/verbs describing a state of relaxation. 'after long working days' provides context."
  },

    "englishText": "Do you prefer relaxing at home or going out?",

    "japaneseTranslation": "私は間違いなく外向的な人間なので、外で過ごすことを好みますし、普段は友達や家族と時間を過ごします。",
    "explanation": "Grammar issue: 'I definitely an extrovert person' should be 'I am definitely an extrovert person' or 'I'm definitely an extrovert'. 'keen on hanging outside' is good. 'or I would usually spend time' - the 'or' here might imply a choice between hanging outside and spending time with friends/family, but it seems more like two related activities. It could be smoother as: 'I'm definitely an extrovert, so I enjoy hanging out outside and usually spend time with my friends and family.'"

    "japaneseTranslation": "しかし、特に一人で過ごすときは、自分のソーシャルバッテリーを充電できるような気がして、気分がずっと良くなります。",
    "explanation": "'but especially I spend time with myself' - the 'but' here contrasts with the previous statement about being extroverted, implying that even extroverts need alone time. This is a good point. 'when I'm being alone' is fine. 'recharge my social battery' is a very common and natural idiom. 'I feel much better' is a clear statement of the outcome. The grammar is correct."

    "japaneseTranslation": "週末の過ごし方は時間とともにどのように変化しましたか？",
    "explanation": "Grammar issue: 'How is the way you spend the weekends changes' is grammatically incorrect. It should be 'How has the way you spend your weekends changed over time?' or 'How have your weekend activities changed over time?'. The question is understandable, but the phrasing is awkward."
  },

    "japaneseTranslation": "もちろんです。ちょうど、私の趣味や週末のアクティビティが当初から大きく変わったことに気づきました。",
    "explanation": "Grammar issue: 'my activities at the weekend has changed' should be 'my activities at the weekend have changed' (plural subject 'activities'). 'Absolutely, yes' is a strong affirmation. 'I've just realized' is good. 'from the beginning' is clear. The sentence conveys the intended meaning despite the subject-verb agreement error."

    "explanation": "'In the past, I used to prefer stay in my house' should be 'In the past, I used to prefer staying in my house'. 'surfing the internet' is correct. 'but then I realized I need my memories and my beloved people' is a good statement of realization. The grammar error is minor."

    "japaneseTranslation": "なぜなら、私はLe Quy Don高校に通っていますが、そこは活気ある大都市、ホーチミン市にあり、私の学校のすべての生徒が写真を撮るのが本当に上手だからです。",
    "explanation": "Grammar issue: 'leaning at' should be 'learning at' or 'attending'. 'thriving metropolis' is good vocabulary. 'where every students at my school are really good at taking photos' - 'every student' (singular) is more common than 'every students' (plural), although 'every students' is sometimes used colloquially. 'really good at taking photos' is natural. The sentence is a bit long but understandable."

    "explanation": "'Moreover' is a good transition word. 'talented photographic club' is clear. 'named the Origins' is correct. 'So that's the reason why I really want to learn a little bit about this skill' is a bit redundant ('reason why').

    "explanation": "'passionate about photography for a variety of reasons' is excellent. 'Firstly' is a good way to start listing reasons. 'I'm a person that really appreciate memories' should be 'I'm a person who really appreciates memories' or 'I'm someone who really appreciates memories'. The use of 'that' instead of 'who' is common in spoken English but 'who' is preferred for people. 'appreciate memories' is good."
